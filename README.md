# Kattis

I'm in love with the Kattis Problem Archive! The Kattis folder has some solutions to Kattis problems. They are mostly written in C++, though a couple are in Python3.

# LeetCode

LeetCode does not currently support OCaml, so I decided to post some solutions in this language. There are only a few now, but I hope to expand this selection soon.

If you have any questions about any of the solutions, please feel free to drop me an e-mail me at dani@ffmoura.com :)
